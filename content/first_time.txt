Hey there, let me explain a few things to ya before you go and get yourself killed.
This view of your existence is what we gods call the World Tree.
We're letting you see the same as us so that you can get what you need to craft what we want.
The first node you see here is your home node.
Here you can rest up, save your progress, and look at what you've discovered.
To the left is the crafting node.  You can make stuff there!
You should be sure to check out the recipes for crafting before you go hunting.
Knowing what you need is the first step to getting things done faster!
To the right is the filesystem node.  Your entrypoint to the hard drive and internet.
You'll need to explore the filesystem to find the items you need to craft.
Be careful, as the filesystem is a bit dangerous.
If you don't make it out alive, you'll lose all the items you found on that dive.
When adventuring, be sure to keep track of the dates as well, in particular the lunar cycle.
Enemies can get tougher during a full moon, and bosses become more frequent during an eclipse.
More nodes exist within the World tree, but its inhabitants might not want to reveal them to you.
Some things that the nodes offer might make your quest much easier, so keep unlocking them in mind.
Your quest will be over once you craft all that we ask for.
We'll let you go do your thing now, bye!
