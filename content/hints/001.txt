Hooray~  You crafted something for me!
For actually going through with all this and actually helping me, let me tell you a secret!
If you haven't figured it out by now, some enemies are a bit deceptive.
Michael Bay's have a high amount of HP, but are actually incredibly weak on lower levels.
Be sure to be the snot out of them to get some items easily.
On the flip side, plants which have relatively low HP can deal some serious damage if you're not careful.
Even still, never underestimate your opponent!
And remember, if you're ever afraid of how hard they can hit you can always just befriend them for a few items.
Hope you have fun with this secret!  Goodbye~
