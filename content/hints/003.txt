Hooray~  You crafted something for me!
For actually going through with all this and actually helping me, let me tell you a secret!
The great developer of your reality kind of forgot to remove debug settings from your world
Certain commandline options exist that can change up the game.
By appending -debug to the launch command, you can enter debug mode, which provides you with tons for testing.
While you can save your game, it's hard to consider this as anything other than cheating.
Hope you have fun with this secret!  Goodbye~
