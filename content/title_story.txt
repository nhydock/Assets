It wasn't long ago that this digital world did not exist.
A world of hand-made goods, a world built on bartering.



...The bronze age, the iron age, the denim age...
since the beginning of time people from around the world made things.

All along this path their gods and goddesses supported them in their endeavors




Recently, the divine have become distraught.

Ashamed by the lack of mankind's imagination, tainted by man's desire to steal and disfigure everything with overused jokes.

With powerful tools that make creation easier, no one believes in their gods anymore.

To make matters worse, with no one to worship them, the divine may cease to exist...














A goddess comes down to address our hero...
A god comes down to address our heroine...


They wish to restore faith,
to bring about a new era of crafting.


Together they wish to show the world that from the digital depths even trash may bare originality and creativity.
